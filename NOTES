I use this pattern to manage projects:
  branch main is for introducing a technology
  branch <project> will have some pruning of branch main
  branch <project>-<task> introduces a new feature to the project
I then use branch-manager to navigate the branches.

To find widgets and associate them with code:
  clone https://github.com/cfnz/muirwik
  ./gradlew :muirwik-testapp:run
  [IntelliJ] -> Open <muirwik basedir>
      Project -> muirwik-testapp/src/main/kotlin/com..ccfraser.muirwik.testapp
  Now look at the code associated with what you were trying to add.
